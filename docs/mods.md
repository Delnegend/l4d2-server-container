# Installing mods

Every mod lands in one of two places, and the difference matters more than it
sounds: **on the volume** (this server only, survives restarts) or **baked into
the image** (versioned, reproducible, needs a rebuild).

| | On the volume | Baked into the image |
|---|---|---|
| Reaches | this server | every server built from the image |
| Changed by | dropping files in | a commit and a rebuild |
| Tracked in git | no | yes |
| Right for | plugins you are trialling, a map for one group | anything everyone should have |

Two things to decide first: *where* it lives, and *what kind* of mod it is:
a SourceMod plugin, a MetaMod extension, or map/campaign content.

---

## The rule that governs everything

On every start the entrypoint copies the overlay the image carries at
`/opt/l4d2-overlay` over the install, and it merges `addons/` and `cfg/`
differently on purpose:

```text
data/left4dead2/addons/         image overlay symlinked in; user files on volume stick
data/left4dead2/cfg/            no-clobber - seeded from the image only where missing
data/left4dead2/maps/           yours, real directory on volume
data/left4dead2/scripts/        yours, real directory on volume
```

So:

- **A file in `cfg/`, `maps/` or `scripts/` sticks.** Real files on the volume,
  surviving restarts.
- **A custom plugin or file in `addons/` sticks across restarts too.**
  The entrypoint symlinks the image's mod overlay without deleting existing
  volume files. If you run in `SERVER_MODE=vanilla` mode, image overlay symlinks are
  temporarily unlinked, leaving your custom volume files intact.

`cfg/` is seeded with no-clobber rather than overwritten, because
`server_custom.cfg`, `sourcemod.cfg` and `l4dmultislots.cfg` are yours to tune.

> **Keep content that costs you a download out of `addons/`.** A campaign VPK
> there survives restarts but not a game update, and the loss is silent; the
> server boots perfectly without it. `maps/` and `scripts/` are real directories
> the overlay never touches, and the engine loads from them, so a campaign that
> belongs to the server rather than the image belongs there. Anything you cannot
> re-download in a minute should be baked into the overlay instead.

## SourceMod plugins (`.smx`)

### Baked into the image

The right answer for anything that should be on every server, and the only way
to get a plugin that needs a build step. The overlay is staged at
`/opt/l4d2-overlay/left4dead2`, so a plugin lands there rather than in an
install:

```dockerfile
ARG MYPLUGIN_REF=<commit-sha>
RUN set -eux; \
    plugins=/opt/l4d2-overlay/left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/plugins; \
    curl -fsSL -o /tmp/p.smx \
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/${MYPLUGIN_REF}/build/myplugin.smx"; \
    install -m 0644 /tmp/p.smx "${plugins}/myplugin.smx"; \
    rm -f /tmp/p.smx
```

No `chown` is needed: the entrypoint copies the overlay as an unprivileged user
and `--no-preserve=ownership` makes that work.

Pin it to a commit, not a branch, so a rebuild gets the same bytes. A `.smx`
that is fetched from a forum attachment rather than a package feed has no such
option; that is why `assets/left4dhooks.zip` is vendored and checked against
`LEFT4DHOOKS_SHA256` instead.

### Dependencies

A SourceMod plugin rarely ships alone, and the failures are quiet unless you
read the log. These are the four seen in practice, verbatim:

| Log line | Missing |
|---|---|
| `Could not find required plugin "X"` | another `.smx` that must load first |
| `Error parsing gameconfig file "…/X.txt"` / `Stream failed to open` | the plugin's `gamedata/` file |
| `Fatal error encountered parsing translation file "X.phrases.txt"` | the plugin's `translations/` file |
| `unsupported feature set; code is too new` | the plugin is compiled against a newer SourceMod than the image ships |

Some plugins also need a **library**: a `.inc` in
`addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/`. SourceMod decides a library is present
by finding that file on disk at load time, so the include has to be installed
even though the plugin is already compiled. `l4dmultislots` needs Multi-Colors
this way.

If a plugin's archive contains `addons/sourcemod/...`, extract it with that
layout intact. If it contains a bare `sourcemod/...`, the tree belongs in
`addons/`.

---

## MetaMod extensions (`.so` + `.vdf`)

An extension is a library the engine loads itself, ahead of SourceMod; that is
what l4dtoolz is. It needs two files in `addons/`, and the **`.vdf` is what
makes the engine load it**:

```vdf
"Plugin"
{
	"file"	"addons/mytoolz"
}
```

Dropping both files straight into `data/left4dead2/addons/` persists across
restarts, but only until the next install is replaced, at which point they go
with everything else in `addons/`. Bake them into the overlay if the extension
is meant to be permanent:

```bash
podman compose cp ./mytoolz.so l4d2:/data/left4dead2/addons/
podman compose cp ./mytoolz.vdf l4d2:/data/left4dead2/addons/
podman compose restart l4d2
```

The path inside the `.vdf` is relative to the game directory and normally has no
extension: `addons/mytoolz` finds `mytoolz.so`.

**Ship the 32-bit build.** L4D2's engine is 32-bit here, and the image strips
MetaMod's `linux64/` module; that is the source of the harmless
`Unable to load plugin "addons/metamod/bin/linux64/server"` line in the log.

---

## Maps and campaigns

| Content | Goes in |
|---|---|
| Map (`.vpk`) | `data/left4dead2/maps/` |
| Campaign `.txt` definition | `data/left4dead2/scripts/` |
| Campaign VPKs | `data/left4dead2/maps/` |

Both directories are real and untouched by the overlay, so files land next to
the stock content and survive a game update.

Workshop VPKs are conventionally dropped straight into
`data/left4dead2/addons/`, because that is where the engine looks for mounted
content and it is what the workshop tooling does. It works, and it survives
restarts, but an install swap deletes it, silently, and the server boots
without the campaign. If a map is worth more than a re-download, move it to
`maps/` once you are happy with it.

Two cvars matter for custom content, and the image already sets both:

- **`sv_consistency 0`** must stay 0. The consistency check rejects custom
  model and VPK files outright, and the symptom is content silently not
  loading.
- **`precache_all_survivors 1`** preloads every survivor model, which is what
  stops the server crashing once more than four different characters are in
  play.

Workshop "addons" are mostly client-side and do nothing for the server. If a
workshop item is a map or campaign, the server needs the files in the paths
above; if it is a client mutator or HUD, it does not.

---

## Verifying a mod actually loaded

**The log is the reliable check, and silence is the pass condition.** A clean
plugin load prints nothing at all; any `[SM]` line means something did not
load.

```bash
podman compose logs l4d2 | grep -E '\[SM\]'      # empty = everything loaded
```

`just smoke` automates exactly that against a freshly built image, and also
reports how many of the expected plugins are present.

From a connected client, the in-game console is the other view: `sm plugins`
lists what SourceMod loaded, `meta list` what MetaMod has. Those are the
standard SourceMod and MetaMod commands; the log check above is the one verified
in this repository's own tests, because it needs no client.

Then, for a plugin that changes behaviour, actually use it. A plugin that loads
and does nothing is usually a cvar in its own config file that never got set.

---

## A worked example

Adding a plugin to one server only, and not to the image:

```bash
# 1. install the plugin and anything it needs
podman compose cp ./myplugin.smx          l4d2:/data/left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/plugins/
podman compose cp ./myplugin_gamedata.txt l4d2:/data/left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/

# 2. restart and read the log
podman compose restart l4d2
podman compose logs l4d2 | grep -E '\[SM\]'      # empty = good
```

That works across restarts. It does **not** survive an install being replaced:
a manifest change or a new volume, because everything in `addons/` goes then.
To make it stick for good, either stage it in the overlay as above, or have the
server load it from a directory the overlay does not touch:

```bash
podman compose exec l4d2 mkdir -p /data/left4dead2/mods/mine
podman compose cp ./myplugin.smx l4d2:/data/left4dead2/mods/mine/
podman compose exec l4d2 sh -c \
  'echo "sm plugins load /data/left4dead2/mods/mine/myplugin.smx" >> /data/left4dead2/cfg/server_custom.cfg'
podman compose restart l4d2
```

Decide afterwards whether it earned a place in the image: if every server should
have it, move it into the `server` stage in the `Dockerfile` and delete the
volume copy.
