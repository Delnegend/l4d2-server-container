Five things are pinned by an ARG in the Dockerfile, and this is what says
whether each one is stale:

  game_manifest        the public manifest id of depot 222861 of app 222860 -
                       the game itself, ~9.5 GB, 116 977 files.
  launcher_manifest    the public manifest id of depot 222863 of the same app -
                       674 files, and the only one of the two that carries
                       srcds_run. Steam versions the depots independently, so
                       this is a separate pin rather than a second half of the
                       first.
  l4dtoolz_version,
  l4dtoolz_build       the newest stable lakwsh/l4dtoolz release that ships the
                       l4dtoolz-<version>-<build>.zip the Dockerfile downloads. A
                       release that only ships the rolling -main.zip cannot be
                       pinned, so it is skipped.
  plugins_ref          head commit of fbef0102/L4D1_2-Plugins.
  block_logon_release,
  block_logon_asset    the newest blueblur0730/modified-plugins release that
                       ships the SourceMod 1.12 bypass zip the Dockerfile
                       unpacks. 1.13-only releases cannot be pinned, so they
                       are skipped.

MetaMod and SourceMod are reported and never bumped: the Dockerfile resolves
both to the newest build on SOURCEMOD_BRANCH at build time, so a new drop needs
no pin changed - only a rebuild.

GITHUB_TOKEN is optional. Without it the GitHub calls are unauthenticated and
rate limited per source address, which is enough for one run a day.
